# Password-Generator
This is a quick password generator that I made and it saves the password to a text file with what the password is for

Instructions:         
Step 1. open up the python file and click on the "click for password" button to start making a password.                    
Step 2. type what you want the password for (youtube, twitch, ect).          
Step 3. once it has come up with a password it will tell you the password and it will be saved in a text document for you! (you don't have to make the text document it does that for you)                                                                                                                                             
 
Also leave the python file in its own folder so you don't make the text document create itself in a different folder.                           
you can also edit the length by editing the length varible in the script the defualt is 9.
